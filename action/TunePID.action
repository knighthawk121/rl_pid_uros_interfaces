# Action definition for PID tuning
# File: rl_pid_uros/action/TunePid.action

# Goal Definition
# These are the parameters sent to start the tuning process
# Each parameter is a floating-point value representing a PID coefficient
float64 kp    # Proportional gain coefficient
float64 ki    # Integral gain coefficient
float64 kd    # Derivative gain coefficient
int64 target_position #specified target position the motor has to reach 0 - 360 degrees
---
# Result Definition
# This is sent once when the tuning process completes
# It provides information about the final state of the system
float64 final_error    # The final error value when tuning completed
---
# Feedback Definition
# This is sent periodically during the tuning process
# It provides real-time information about the system's state
float64 current_error      # Current error between target and actual position
int64 current_position    # Current motor position in encoder counts
int64 target_position     # Target position the system is trying to reach
bool motor_stopped     # Motor has reached target/stalled
bool error_stable     # Error has stabilized
float64 velocity      # Current motor velocity
